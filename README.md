## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

1. **OpenProject Instance**: You need a running OpenProject installation (local or cloud)
2. **API Key**: Generate an API key from your OpenProject profile
3. **Python 3.8+**: Required for running the MCP server

### Installation

1. **Clone or download** the project:
   ```bash
   cd openproject-mcp-server
   ```

2. **Create and activate virtual environment**:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Configure environment**:
   ```bash
   cp env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your OpenProject details
   ```

### Configuration

Edit the `.env` file with your OpenProject details:

```env
# OpenProject Instance URL (include protocol)
OPENPROJECT_URL=http://localhost:3000

# OpenProject API Key (from your user profile)
OPENPROJECT_API_KEY=your_40_character_api_key_here

# MCP Server Configuration (optional)
MCP_HOST=localhost
MCP_PORT=8080
MCP_LOG_LEVEL=INFO
```

#### Getting your OpenProject API Key:

1. Login to your OpenProject instance
2. Go to **My Account** → **Access Tokens**
3. Click **+ New token**
4. Enter a name (e.g., "MCP Server")
5. Copy the generated 40-character token

### Testing

Test your configuration before using with AI assistants:

```bash
python3 scripts/test_mvp.py
```

This will:
- ✅ Test OpenProject API connection
- ✅ Create a test project
- ✅ Create work packages with dates
- ✅ Create dependencies
- ✅ Verify Gantt chart readiness

### Running the Server

Start the MCP server:

```bash
python3 scripts/run_server.py
```

The server will start and be ready to accept AI assistant connections.

## 🐳 Docker Deployment

Docker deployment is the **recommended production method** for the OpenProject MCP Server.

### Prerequisites for Docker

1. **Docker installed** (version 20.10+)
2. **Docker Compose** (for easier management)
3. **Configure `.env` file** with your OpenProject details

### Quick Start with Docker

**Option 1: Automated deployment (Recommended)**
```bash
# Configure your environment first
cp env.example .env
# Edit .env with your OpenProject URL and API key

# Deploy on specific port (IMPORTANT: Must match Claude Desktop config)
./scripts/deploy.sh deploy 39127

# Alternative: Deploy on default port 8080
./scripts/deploy.sh deploy

# For development with different ports
./scripts/deploy.sh deploy 9876
```

**🔑 Important**: The port MUST match your Claude Desktop MCP configuration in `~/.cursor/mcp.json` or `claude_desktop_config.json`!

**Option 2: Docker Compose (Alternative)**
```bash
# Build and start the container
docker-compose up -d

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f

# Stop the container
docker-compose down
```

**🔧 Port Configuration & Conflicts:**

**Step 1: Choose your port (must be consistent)**
```bash
# Check your current MCP configuration
cat ~/.cursor/mcp.json | grep openproject -A 5

# Or check Claude Desktop config
cat ~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
```

**Step 2: Deploy on the SAME port as your MCP config**
```bash
# Deploy on the port specified in your MCP config
./scripts/deploy.sh deploy 39127
```

**Step 3: If port conflicts occur:**
- Stop conflicting services: `docker stop container_using_port`
- Or update BOTH MCP config AND deployment port consistently
- Check what's using port: `docker ps | grep 39127`

### Manual Docker Commands

For advanced users who want full control:

1. **Build the image**:
   ```bash
   docker build -t openproject-mcp-server .
   ```

2. **Run the container**:
   ```bash
   docker run -d \
     --name openproject-mcp-server \
     --env-file .env \
     -p 39127:8080 \
     -v ./logs:/app/logs \
     -v ./data:/app/data \
     --restart unless-stopped \
     openproject-mcp-server
   ```

3. **Health check**:
   ```bash
   # Check if container is healthy
   docker ps
   
   # View container logs
   docker logs openproject-mcp-server
   
   # Test API endpoint (Note: No health endpoint in MCP server)
   curl http://localhost:39127/sse
   ```

### Deployment Script Commands

The `scripts/deploy.sh` script provides comprehensive deployment management:

```bash
# Deploy on standard MCP port (recommended)
./scripts/deploy.sh deploy 39127

# Deploy on default port 8080 (may conflict with OpenProject)
./scripts/deploy.sh deploy

# Deploy on alternative ports if needed
./scripts/deploy.sh deploy 9876

# View container logs
./scripts/deploy.sh logs

# Check status and port information
./scripts/deploy.sh status

# Stop the server
./scripts/deploy.sh stop

# Restart the server (keeps same port)
./scripts/deploy.sh restart

# Clean up (stop and remove container/image)
./scripts/deploy.sh clean
```

**💡 Port Selection Tips:**
- **Port 39127**: Recommended MCP standard port, matches default config
- **Port 8080**: Default HTTP port, but often conflicts with OpenProject
- **Port 9876**: Good alternative, rarely conflicts
- **Port 8090**: Common development port

### Environment Variables for Docker

When using Docker, configure these environment variables in your `.env` file:

```env
# OpenProject Instance URL (where your OpenProject runs, typically port 8080)
OPENPROJECT_URL=http://localhost:8080

# OpenProject API Key (from your user profile)
OPENPROJECT_API_KEY=your_40_character_api_key_here

# MCP Server Configuration (internal container port, mapped to 39127)
MCP_HOST=0.0.0.0
MCP_PORT=8080
MCP_LOG_LEVEL=INFO

# Optional: Performance tuning (Phase 1 features)
OPENPROJECT_CACHE_TIMEOUT_MINUTES=5
OPENPROJECT_PAGINATION_SIZE=100
OPENPROJECT_MAX_RETRIES=3
```

### Docker Deployment Best Practices

- **Always use `.env` file** - Never hardcode credentials in commands
- **Volume mapping** - Map logs and data directories for persistence
- **Health checks** - Container includes built-in health monitoring
- **Auto-restart** - Use `--restart unless-stopped` for production
- **Resource limits** - Consider adding memory/CPU limits for production

## 🤖 AI Assistant Integration

### Claude Desktop Integration

Add to your `claude_desktop_config.json`:

**Option 1: Local Python execution**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "openproject": {
      "command": "python3",
      "args": ["/full/path/to/openproject-mcp-server/scripts/run_server.py"],
      "env": {
        "OPENPROJECT_URL": "http://localhost:8080",
        "OPENPROJECT_API_KEY": "your_api_key_here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Option 2: Docker deployment (recommended)**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "openproject": {
      "transport": "sse",
      "url": "http://localhost:39127/sse"
    }
  }
}
```

**Environment Setup:** Configure OpenProject credentials in Docker deployment `.env` file instead of MCP config.

**Important Notes**: 
- Use the full absolute path to the `run_server.py` script for Option 1
- Ensure the Docker container is running before using Option 2
- OPENPROJECT_URL should point to your OpenProject instance (typically port 8080)
- MCP server URL (port 39127) is configured separately in the transport URL

### Usage Examples

Once integrated with Claude, you can ask:

#### Create a Project with Team Members
```
Create a new project called "Website Redesign" with description "Complete redesign of company website". 
Then show me the available users and add john@example.com and sarah@example.com to the project.
```

#### Create Work Packages with Email-based Assignment
```
In project ID 5, create these work packages:
1. "Requirements Analysis" from 2024-01-15 to 2024-01-20, assign to john@example.com
2. "UI Design" from 2024-01-21 to 2024-02-05, assign to sarah@example.com
3. "Development" from 2024-02-06 to 2024-02-28, assign to mike@example.com
4. "Testing & Launch" from 2024-03-01 to 2024-03-10, assign to alice@example.com
```

#### Create Dependencies for Gantt Chart
```
Create dependencies so that:
- UI Design follows Requirements Analysis
- Development follows UI Design  
- Testing follows Development
```

#### User Management Examples
```
Show me all users in the system
Find the user with email "john@example.com"
Show me all members of project ID 5 and their roles
```

#### Dynamic Configuration Examples
```
What work package types are available in this OpenProject instance?
Show me all possible work package statuses
What priority levels can I use for work packages?
```

#### Phase 2 Examples - Status Updates & Comments
```
Change work package 42 status to "In progress"
Update work package 38 and set its status to "Closed"
Add a comment to work package 42: "Completed the initial analysis and moving to implementation phase"
Show me all activity history for work package 38 including comments and status changes
```

#### Phase 2 Examples - Advanced Filtering
```
Search for all work packages with status "New" in project 3
Find all work packages assigned to user ID 5 that are in "In progress" status
Show me work packages created after 2025-11-18 sorted by updated date
Find overdue work packages (due before today)
Search for work packages with "bug" in the subject
Show me the first 5 work packages in project 1, sorted by priority
Get work packages in status 1 or 2, assigned to user 5, in project 3
Find work packages created between 2025-11-01 and 2025-11-30
```
